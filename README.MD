#### High-Resolution Molecular Hydrogen Optical Depth Template in [the Lyman-Werner Absorption Bands](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993JMoSp.157..512A)

note: This template library was designed to be an improved version of the work from [McCandiless 2003](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003PASP..115..651M/abstract) (in terms of computational efficiency and spectral resolution). It was used in [Welty, Xue, & Wong 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...745..173W/abstract). The actual template file in [.xdr](https://www.harrisgeospatial.com/docs/SAVE.html) is large (~500MB, not in this repo) but can be regenerated locally using IDL. Now I am translating the old-school ten-year IDL code into Python (likely using the [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/)/[linetools](https://linetools.readthedocs.io/en/latest) APIs)...
